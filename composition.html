    <h1> Composition - A Guide on How to Arrange Visual Elements </h1>        
      </class>
    </p>
    <p>
      Composition- refers to how the photograph was produced given the real world
      scene. Every photographer makes decisions of elements to include or
      exclude, therefore dictating the composition of the photo. Author of The
      Nature of Photographs, Stephen Shore credits composition to have as
      aspects of Frame, Time, Focus and Flatness. These ascepts can be
      controlled through the 4 ways discussed in the exposure section, changing
      the frame of the photograph, or waiting for the right moment. When viewing
      a photograph with good composition, the elements in your photos and how
      your eyes moves from element to element should be natural and satisfying
      in telling the photographs's story. This can be accomplished using Time,
      Frame, and Focus to guide the viewer on a “viewing journey” through
      elements with subtle, but purposeful placement of said elements or
      techniques.
    </p>
<!-- add example pictures -->
    <p>
      As Shore writes, Frame “corrals the content of the photograph all at once. The objects, people, events, or forms that are in the forefront of a photographer's attention when making the fine framing decisions are the recipients of the frame's emphasis. The frame resonates off them and, in turn, draws the viewer's attention to them.” (1) Shore argues that the frame can be active or passive. An passive frame of a photograph has its elements and subjects contained within the borders of the photo and it’s frame, thus serving as something external of a larger world. However, an active frame frame of a photograph is the opposite: when a photograph is connected to the larger world through the photographer's elements. An active frame implements its subjects to seemingly come in or out of the photograph from an external world, creating a more dynamic and emotional photograph. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As photography is static and only captures moments, Shore writes that “the
      duration of the exposure and the staticness of the final image affect
      [time in a photograph] Just as a three-dimensional world is transformed
      when it is projected onto a flat piece of film, so a fluid the world is
      transformed when it is projected onto a static piece of film. The exposure
      has a duration, what John Szarkowski in The Photographer's Eye called 'a
      discrete parcel of time.'” (2)
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, Shore writes about an image’s focus, commenting that “Focus is the
      fourth major transformation of the world into a photograph. Not only does
      a camera see monocularly from a definite vantage point; it also creates a
      hierarchy in the depictive space by defining a single plane of focus.” (3)
      The focus of a photograph can be creatively be used by the photographer to
      add an extra layer of meaning for a photo and its story. For example, the
      depth of field of a photograph by controlling its aperture can emphasize a
      singular subject (imagine a portrait) whereas a large depth of field will
      tell emphasize the significance of the scene itself as a whole (imagine a
      wide-angle).

        “When photography is good, it’s pretty interesting, and when it is very good, it is irrational and even magical… nothing to do with the photographer’s conscious will or desire. When the photograph happens, it comes easily, as a gift that should not be questioned or analyzed.” - Elliott Erwitt’s Personal Best (2006) </a>

      <h4>Ways to improve your photos with Composition Guidelines </h4>
      <p class = white>
        Be Creative with all of these! Now, here are some examples and what kind of
        techniques they utilize to make for more compelling and interesting
        photographs
        </p>
        <div class = Room>
      <h4>Rule of Thirds</h4> 
      <p class = "white">
      Rule of Thirds is one of the most basic and easy to implement composition technique 
      that can help elevate any photograph. The rule calls for the subject of the photo to be placed
       in the left or right third of an image, leaving the other two thirds more open. The Rule of Thirds
       technique is one of the first unique composition tips that photographers learn because of how simple, yet
       effective it is!

      <br> <h4>Color & Juxaposition</h4> 
      <p class = white> Color plays an important role to an image when taking modern-day photos. With color photography as the norm, the color of the background, foreground, or subject can be important to consider when choosing what to include in a photo. If your goal is to isolate a subject, it is best to avoid distracting, bright, and eye-catching colors like red and yellow in the background to leave your subject to shine in the spotlight.
        Color can also be used to further a narrative or story within a photo or collection of photographs. Within a singular photo, color along with other composition techniques like juxtaposition can help tell a story. In the photo below, we see two different sides of the life of a businessman. One is represented by the warm colors of a conference room where chatter and associates fill the room. On the other hand, the single businessman in the other room, characterized by the cool, blue light, could represent the lonelier and competitive side of the profession.

      <br> <h4>Symmetry</h4>
      <p class = white> When two halves (vertical or horizontal) mirror each other. Symmetry within the frame helps a photograph seem aesthetic and balanced. 
        Symmetry in composition isn't about objects that are symmetrical, but rather objects in 
        the scene that present a symmetrical appearence in the photograph. Here, the two wide recievers frame through symmetry the quarterback about to lob the ball.

      <br> <h4>Rule of Odds</h4>
      <p class = white>Put simply, our eyes (for whatever reason) tend to find odd groups visually appealing. 
      When you can, try to get creative by using the rule of odds to have an odd number of subjects in your photo.
      </p>
      <img src = Media/DSC_0786.jpg width = "1000" draggable="false">


      <br><h4>Light & Negative Space</h4> 
      <p class=white>Using a scene's light can help create interesting and unique compositions. 
        If available, pockets of light or different colored lights can create specfic emphasis
         on your subject that help lead the viewer's eye to the subject. When trying this technique,
          try exposing for the picture's highlights to ensure a good exposure.</p>
      <img class = "image" src="Media/_R001475.jpg" width = "1000" draggable="false"><br>


      <br> <h4>Human Form & Black and White</h4> 
      <p class = "white">
        When photographing any subjects, but humans in particular, the way they are posed or
        interact with other subjects in the frame can make for interesting compositions and moments 
        that are worth capturing. Starting to see a theme here? In a lot of great photos, photographers
        will incoperate multiple of these composition guildines to create a strong visual presence in a photograph.
        Here, a black and white image can help accentuate human mood or poses as they elimate any colorful distractions and help viewers focus on the form and 
        shape of your subject.

      <h4>Negative Space</h4>
      <p class = white>having an empty background, causing the
        subject(s) to be highlighted even more</p>

      <br> <h4>High & Low Angle</h4>
      <p class = white> Sometimes called "worm's point of view" for low angles or "bird's eye view" for high angles, positioning your camera and yourself in an higher or lower angle from what the crowd may typically see allows for a unique photograph that is atypical. Remember, as a photographer, you are trying to capture atypical moments that tell a story.

      <br><h4>Framing</h4>       
      <p class =white>Use elements in the foreground (doors, windows, people, nets) to frame and enclose subjects in the background. In the photo below, I used a water polo net to frame the goal keeper’s eyes.
