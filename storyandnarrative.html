      <h3>Story/Narrative</h3>
      <p>
        Whether through a single photo or a endless photo projects, photos have
        the power to tell stories. So, here are some things to keep in mind when
        photographing for a story
      </p>
      <h3>Physical Context: </h3>
      <p>
        <br/>What are elements of the photo you may want to
        include or exclude that gives the viewer context of the photo’s setting?
      </p>

      <p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Blueprint: How to tell a story</h3>
        One of my favorite ways of taking photos is to tell the stories of the
        people around me. Whether that be photos of family get-togethers or my
        friends from high school, photos have the ability to convey a narrative
        through what are known as “decisive moments”, noted by french
        photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson.
      </p>

      <p>
        So naturally, the next question is: how do we accomplish this? Each
        story is unique and therefore will need different ways to approach or
        execute. However, you can generally follow some critical steps that will
        help make your story connect with viewers.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>1. Brainstorming a story </h3>If you are having trouble coming up with a
        story, start with something simple and small. The story doesn’t have to
        be something mind-blowing. To start, think of something that applies to
        what you enjoy or yourself. Tell the story of a day in your life, your
        neighbor and where you live, landscapes of where you live, or local
        events. The best thing to do is to shoot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3> 2. Think about your shots </h3> The next best thing you can do is think about
        what you are shooting and how you will capture the essence of the
        “story” through your photos. You can do this by creating a shot-list.
        Typically, there are two common categories of shots you encounter when
        telling a story. Context These are the types of shots that set the
        setting of your story. They answer the “Where?”, “When?”, “What?” and
        sometimes “How?” questions. You can do this through wider-angled shots
        that show the location of an event, the people involved, etc. Decisive
        Moments These are the shots that happen at the moment and that are
        generally spontaneous and unplanned. These can be hard to account for
        while creating a shot-list, but it can extremely helpful to spend some
        time beforehand thinking about what your decisive moment may be in your time before actually shooting.
        <!-- narrative. “Case Study” - Lebron James broke the career shooting record
        in the NBA of 38,390 points. So what might be the decisive moment for
        Lebron’s story of becoming the #1 career point leader? In my opinion, it
        would be the three-point shot that he made that carried his career point
        statistic from 38,387 to 38,390. -->
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3> 3. Shooting</h3>Now that you have everything ready like your shot-list,
        camera, and lenses, it is time to shoot! Go out in the field and have fun by incoperating
        all of these things!
