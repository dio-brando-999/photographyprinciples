        Hi! My name is Brandon Zau, a 17-year-old photographer based in the Bay Area of California. I created this website as a simple, quick, and fun way to learn about photography and how you can improve your photos to make them more compelling and visually stunning. Even if you are a beginner, I hope you can walk away learning something new or interesting through my words. If you would like to see more of my photography, check out my instagram: <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/bzauphotos/"> @bzauphotos. </a>
