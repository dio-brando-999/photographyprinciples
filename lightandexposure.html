        <h1>Light & Exposure</h1>
    
        <p>
          Photography is capturing the light of a scene and freezing the moment.
          As a result, it is important to understand the four key factors that
          photographers can control to determine a photograph’s end result. All
          photographs ever taken have three elements when it comes to the exposure
          of the image: Aperture, Shutter Speed & ISO
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Aperture- the physical AMOUNT of light being let in by a camera’s lens
          (ex. f/8) Shutter Speed- the amount of TIME the photograph is exposed
          for (ex. 1/1000th) ISO (as referred to as ISO speed)- the camera’s
          “SENSITIVITY” to light (ISO 100)
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Aperture: corresponds to how “open” the lens is. The numerical value is
          called an f-stop. The smaller the f-stop value (ex. f/1.4, f/2.8), the
          more light is being let in (and therefore the wider the lens is “open”).
          These photography terms such as a “wide-open” or a “fast” lens refer to
          the widest aperture or how much the lens can be open respectively.
          However, the faster the aperture, the less depth of field the photo has.
          Aperture control the depth of field, or the amount of the image that
          will be in focus. A shallow depth of field is great for isolating
          subjects from their backgrounds, such as a portrait, while a large depth
          of field is great for including both the subject and the background,
          such as documentary or photojournalism.
        </p>
  
  
        <p>
          Shutter Speed: how fast the camera’s shutter open and closes to take a
          picture. Some photos can be exposed at the shutter speed of 1/4000th of
          a second (freezing the action of a scene extremely well, but only
          letting in a small amount of light) or 1/3rd of a second (blurring any
          motion, while letting in more light compared to a 1/4000th exposure)
          A good rule to follow to reduce motion blur is to take your lens focal length
          and set the shutter speed to be 1/focal length.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          ISO: ISO, sometimes referred to as ISO speed for film, can be thought of
          as how sensitive the camera is to light. The trade off with increasing a
          camera’s ISO is that higher ISOs will produce grainy images that.

Coined after the room to process the film and photographic paper, we can turn on the lightbulb to take a look at some examples of photography principles in action. Let's take a look at some examples of photography principles in action </h1>
          <div class="Room">
      <h4>Large Depth of Field </h4>
      <p class = white>
        A small aperture does not allow for a large amount of light to reach the camera's sensor. As a result, the photo will feature a large depth of field, or a large range that the camera can focus on in the photograph. This photo's aperture is set a f/22.
      </p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <h4>Shallow Depth of Field & ISO</h4>
    <p class = white> A large aperture is responsible for allowing lots of light in. A large aperture also means that the photo will feature a small depth of field, or a small range that the camera can focus on in the photograph. Larger aperture like f/1.4 or f/2.8 are great for portraits as they isolate the subject, like in the photo below. However, also note the grain this image feautres. With a pretty high ISO of 10,000, this photo will have lots of grain that can reduce the sharpness of the photo. Aim for an ISO of below 5,000 for most cameras to avoid this.</p>

    <h4> Shutter Speed: Freezing the Action</h4>
            
    <br><p class =white> In the photo below, I used the settings of f/2.8, 1/200th, and an ISO of 2000. With sports and action shots that involve movement, 9/10 times it is better to freeze all motion completely by using a shutter speed above 1/800th of a second for your shutter speed. However, a lower shutter speed can be used in a creative sense like in this photo. Below, the waterpolo player is in focus, but the slower shutter speed allows for the ball to be blurred, giving it a dramatic effect showing the speed of the game.</p>
